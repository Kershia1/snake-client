Snake game is a very popular single or multiplayer video game. The snake game  concept was initiallialy invented in the late 1970's which achieved noteriety and mass-populatiry in the early 1990's. I used to play this game quite often as a child. This is a fun nostalgic game that I have created to play with my own children as a student at Lighthouse Labs. If you are interested in a detailed article explain the history and cultural impacts of the Snake Game Gener I have included this informative link from [Its Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/taneli-armanto-the-history-of-snake-design-legacies-230221#:~:text=Snake's%20story%20begins%20long%20before,video%20games%20company%2C%20Gremlin%20Interactive.)

In this simple game a player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
